  - Set up the development environment with necessary Python packages.
- **Afternoon:**
  - Start coding the basic structure of the selected algorithm.

### Day 4: Coding and Version Control
- **All Day:**
  - Implement the algorithm.
  - Regular commits to GitHub to ensure progress tracking.

### Day 5: Initial Testing
- **Morning:**
  - Test implemented algorithms with simple data sets.
  - Document initial results and issues.
- **Afternoon:**
  - Refine code based on test results.
  - Update project documentation and planning as necessary.

## Week 2

### Day 8: Data Analysis
- **Morning:**
  - Analyze experiment data.
  - Start drafting the experiments description for the report.
- **Afternoon:**
  - Continue data analysis.
  - Adjust experimental setup if necessary based on preliminary findings.

### Day 9: Report Drafting
- **Morning:**
  - Write the methodology section of the report.
  - Draft the discussion and conclusions based on analysis.
- **Afternoon:**
  - Refine the entire draft, adding the literature list and ensuring all sections are coherent.

### Day 10: Final Review and Submission
